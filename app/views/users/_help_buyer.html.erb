		<h3><strong>Your Business</strong></h3>

		<a id="yourBusiness" class="anchorDestination"></a>

		<p>Use the "User Info" tab to manage company wide business info as well as personal information such as your name. For now we've kept things simple by allowing you a company logo, name, and phone number. The phone number for your company is just our way to keep in touch and verify that your company is legitimate. The phone number you give us when you register will never be made public.</p>

		<hr>

		<h3><strong>Your Account</strong></h3>

		<a id="yourAccount" class="anchorDestination"></a>

		<p>In the future there will be many more options, but for now this is a simple way to access and update your username, email address, and password. Your account information is for personal use and none of this information will be visible to anyone other than you.</p>

		<hr>

		<h3><strong>Supplier Profiles</strong></h3>

		<a id="supplierProfiles" class="anchorDestination"></a>

		<p>As you'll see, we've included each supplier's most basic information like their company name, contact info and location. This is how each profile starts. Suppliers have the option to own and enhance their profile as the want to, like uploading their inventory and featured items.</p>

		<hr>

		<h3><strong>Search</strong></h3>

		<a id="search" class="anchorDestination"></a>

		<hr>

		<h3><strong>Featured Products</strong></h3>

		<a id="featuredProducts" class="anchorDestination"></a>

		<p>Suppliers have the option to post up to 3 featured products for you to see. They could could be posting  something unique, a specimen tree,  a product in a hard to find size,  or discounted items you may need. The most recently featured items will be found in the Supplier News Feed and the Featured Product search.</p>
		
		<hr>

		<h3><strong>News Feed</strong></h3>

		<a id="newsfeed" class="anchorDestination"></a>

		<p>This is where supplier updates will be displayed so everyone can see what is new on LandSpec Pro, all in one place. Updates are generated from Supplier Profiles, so when they  add a  to new Featured Product, or upload a new Inventory, those updates will be displayed in the news feed for everyone to see.</p>

		<hr>

		<h3><strong>Follow</strong></h3>

		<a id="follow" class="anchorDestination"></a>

		<p>Now you can get updates from your favorite suppliers by following them on LandSpec Pro. Following allows you to filter the Supplier Newsfeed to only get updates from the suppliers you are interested in. This is a great way to get updated info from just your favorite suppliers. We will be doing more with this feature in the near future, so let us know what you think and what you would like to see.</p>
