			<h3 id="overview"><strong>Overview</strong></h3>

			<p>We're constantly growing and improving LandSpec Pro to better suit your needs. You can come here for help and tips on taking full advantage of everything LandSpec Pro has to offer. This section will also grow and improve as we add more features to the site. Your feedback is important to us, if you have any suggestions or questions feel free to send them to us by using the feedback button at the bottom of every page.</p>

			<hr>

			<h3 id="yourBusiness"><strong>Your Business</strong></h3>

			<p>Use the "Company" tab to manage company wide business info. For now we've kept things simple by allowing you a company logo, name, tagline, and phone number. The phone number for your company is just our way to keep in touch and verify your company.  The phone number you give us when you register will never made public.</p>

			<hr>

			<h3 id="yourAccount"><strong>Your Account</strong></h3>

			<p>The account page is also very simple. In the future there will be many more options, but for now this is a simple way to access and update your username, email address, and password. Your account information is for personal use and none of this information will be visible to anyone other than you.</p>

			<hr>

			<h3 id="managingLocations"><strong>Suppliers</strong></h3>

			<p>As you'll see, we've included each supplier's most basic information like their company name, logo, contact info and location. These suppliers are the backbone of the content you'll find on LandSpec Pro.</p>

			<hr>

			<h3 id="featuredItems"><strong>Products</strong></h3>

			<p>The main focus of LandSpec Pro is the content that our suppliers provide. We put visual information up front so you can see everything first. We are personally curating this content to make sure that suppliers are featuring high-quality images and content that is always up to date.</p>

			<p>Instead of giving you lists of hundreds of items to sort through, we're putting featured items up front. You probably know where to get all the bread-and-butter items for your landscaping products, but it's those specialty items that really make a landscape stand out, so we're putting the focus on the items that not everyone can find.</p>

			<p>We don't tell suppliers what they can and can't feature, but we encourage users to display items that are special for various reasons, be it a rare breed, a unique size, a custom made product, or even discounts on more common items. Any product can be special and we're making it easy for you to find those items on LandSpec Pro.</p>
			
			<hr>
			
			<h3 id="search"><strong>Search</strong></h3>

			<p>This is how you will find suppliers and featured items on LandSpec Pro. We're still spending a lot of time improving this and giving you the best way to discover and reach out to suppliers. You can search for suppliers by name or location, as well as simply browsing all the products and suppliers currently on LandSpec Pro.</p>

			<hr>

			<h3 id="favorites"><strong>Favorites</strong></h3>

			<p>Favorites are our way of letting users keep track of their favorite products and suppliers so they can come back and check up on them later. Expect to see a lot of features added here in the future as well.</p>

			<hr>

			<h3 id="newsfeed"><strong>News Feed</strong></h3>

			<p>This is where LandSpec Pro supplier updates will be displayed so you can see what is new, all in one place. The News Feed with show when a company is added to LandSpec Pro, when a new Featured Item is added, or when a new inventory or product availability is uploaded.</p>

			<hr>
