				<p>We've made it simple for you to host and share your full product inventory, in whatever format you want, with your existing and potential customers. We host it for you in the cloud so you know you'll always have a backup, and we give you the options to share it painlessly.</p>

				<p>I'll need to actually change most of this content so that it set up more to say that you can pay us to host and share your full inventory. View it, track previous versions, etc. I'll need to update the database and set it up so that the inventory is a separate table that links to the location. </p>
